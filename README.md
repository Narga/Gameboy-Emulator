## Gameboy Emulator
My first emulator program for higher learning purposes.

This is in _no way_ intended to emulate games for the Nintendo Game Boy®. This is meant to be a Gameboy Emulator, not a Nintendo Game Boy® Emulator. There is a clear difference here. Anybody who has the desire to steal money from Nintendo by emulating games on non-designated hardware deserves to rot in hell. Multi-billion dollar corporations are people too, and they have mouths to feed. I want it to be known that I absolutely deplore this kind of illegal action. Glad we could get this clear.
